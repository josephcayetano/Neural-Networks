# Neural Networks
### Overview
This project used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant seedlings into 12 species, helping with weed detection in farming. It included image preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) â€“ Plant Seedling Classification
- Built and trained a CNN model using image data with augmentation to improve learning
- Reached about 67% test accuracy and a 0.66 F1-score
- Used dropout and early stopping to reduce overfitting and handle class imbalance
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, F1-score, and a confusion matrix; saved the trained model in .h5 format for future use
